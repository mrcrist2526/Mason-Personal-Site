# My personal portfolio 
23 year-old self-taught developer looking to make a hobby a profession.

Learning to play the guitar introduced me to the excitement that comes with creativity and problem-solving. Web development is where I found a passion for it. Very few things are as exciting as seeing an element fall perfectly into place, getting a correct output logged in the console, or figuring out a problem I thought was hopeless.

I graduated with a journalism-specific degree from Purdue University Northwest in 2021 amid the early pandemic. I was introduced to code by a friend of mine around that same time. I began writing articles for a local paper after I graduated and browsed through MDN Web Docs in my spare time.

Something I used to think was magic started making sense. The first time I got "Hello world" to pop up in my browser I was hooked, but still full of questions. These questions took me to YouTube Videos, Udemy courses, StackOverflow, and back to the documentation. Six months later, it's making sense, but I know I will always be learning.

Lately, I have been working through Marjin Haverbeke's Eloquent Javascript to clean up my code, experimenting with IoT projects to learn more about computer hardware, and coding up application ideas I come up with like the one below.
